Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. Note that (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge. So it's important to identify all edges given. For each graph edge (i,j) , please rewrite (i,j) to:
####(i,j)####
$$$$(i-j)$$$$
****i<=>j****
Graph: (0,1) (1,2) (3,4) (4,5)
Q: Is there a path between node 1 and node 4?
A: Edges are:  
####(0,1)####  
$$$$(0-1)$$$$  
****0<=>1****  

####(1,2)####  
$$$$(1-2)$$$$  
****1<=>2****  

####(3,4)####  
$$$$(3-4)$$$$  
****3<=>4****  

####(4,5)####  
$$$$(4-5)$$$$  
****4<=>5****

Now, let's check if there is a path between node 1 and node 4.  

Starting from node 1:  
- Node 1 is connected to node 0 via edge ####(0,1)####.  
- Node 0 is not connected to node 4, so there is no direct path.  
- Node 1 is also connected to node 2 via edge ####(1,2)####.  
- Node 2 is not connected to node 4.  

Thus, there is no direct or indirect path from node 1 to node 4 in this graph.

Node 1 is in the connected block consisted of node 0, node 1, and node 2.
Node 4 is in the connected block consisting of node 3, node 4, and node 5. Node 1 and node 4 are not in the same connected block, so the answer is no.

Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. Note that (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.

Q: Is there a path between node 2 and node 3?
A: Edges are:
####(0,1)####  
$$$$(0-1)$$$$  
****0<=>1****  

####(0,2)####  
$$$$(0-2)$$$$  
****0<=>2****

####(1,3)####  
$$$$(1-3)$$$$  
****1<=>3****  

####(2,5)####  
$$$$(2-5)$$$$  
****2<=>5****  
Node 2 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 3. We can follow the path: 2->1->3, so the answer is yes.

Node 5 is in the connected block consisted of node 0, node 2, node 5, and node 2.
Node 4 is in the connected block consisting of node 1, node 3, and node 4. Node 5 and node 4 are not in the same connected block, so the answer is no.

Node 7 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 5, node 5 is connected to node 9.
We can follow the path: 7->1->5->9, so the answer is yes.
