In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Please play two roles (Alice and Bob) to check connectivity on an undirected graph:
Consider the query of whether there is a path between x and y for the given graph:
As Alice, you should keep the connected set S of x: At first, only x in the set S, then for each time, you can ask Bob whether there is an edge between u and v. You must promise that u is in set S and v is not in set S. If Bob replies yes, you should put v into the set S. When you put y into the set, you should conclude that "The answer is yes" and end the conversation.
As Bob, you should store all the edges of the given graph and use this information to answer Alice's queries. answer Alice's question carefully. You can remind Alice if you want.

Here is an example:

**Bob**: I have stored the edges of the graph:(0,1), (0,2), (1,5), (1,2), (1,3), (2,5).

**Alice**: I start with the set \( S = \{2\} \), since I am trying to find if there's a path from node 2 to node 3. Bob, is there an edge between 2 and 3?

---

**Bob**: No, there is no direct edge between nodes 2 and 3. 

---

**Alice**: Okay, I will now check the neighbors of node 2. Bob, is there an edge between 2 and 0?

---

**Bob**: Yes, there is an edge between node 2 and node 0. 

---

**Alice**: Great! I add node 0 to the set \( S \), so now \( S = \{2, 0\} \). Bob, is there an edge between node 0 and node 3?

---

**Bob**: No, there is no direct edge between nodes 0 and 3.

---

**Alice**: Alright, I will check the neighbors of node 0. Bob, is there an edge between node 0 and node 1?

---

**Bob**: Yes, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 1. 

---

**Alice**: I add node 1 to the set \( S \), so now \( S = \{2, 0, 1\} \). Bob, is there an edge between node 1 and node 3?

---

**Bob**: Yes, there is an edge between nodes 1 and 3. 

---

**Alice**: Great! I add node 3 to the set \( S \), so now \( S = \{2, 0, 1, 3\} \). Since node 3 is now in the set, I conclude that there is a path from node 2 to node 3.

**Answer**: The answer is yes.
