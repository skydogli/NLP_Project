To find a topological sort in a directed graph, you can follow the following steps:
1. Identify all the nodes in the given graph.
2. Construct an adjacency matrix A. And let the diagonal elements of A be 1.
3. Calculate A^n, by do A:=A*A log(n) times, here n is the number of nodes. After each iteration, you can let each element take the minimum between 1 and it.
4. Let b(i) be the number of 0s in row i.
5. The topological order is just the ascending order of b.
