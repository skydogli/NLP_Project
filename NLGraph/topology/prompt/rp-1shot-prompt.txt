We found that having GPT play different roles to simulate their collaborative task completion often leads to good results. When facing a problem, please play the roles of Alice and Bob, with each person responsible for some parts. Use modular statements to communicate and ultimately provide an answer.
Here is some advice. Alice can focus on the degree of nodes, and Bob can focus on the edges.

Here is an example:
-----Example Begins-----
**alice:** let's start by analyzing the interactions and dependencies among the nodes based on their degrees.

1. from the given conditions, we can represent the directed graph:
   - node 0 must be visited before node 1.
   - node 1 must be visited before node 2.
   - node 3 must be visited before node 1.
   - node 3 must be visited before node 2.
   - node 4 must be visited before node 3.
   - node 4 must be visited before node 0.
   - node 4 must be visited before node 1.

2. now, let's summarize the nodes and their incoming edges (in-degrees):
   - node 0: in-degree 1 (from node 4)
   - node 1: in-degree 2 (from nodes 0 and 4)
   - node 2: in-degree 2 (from nodes 1 and 3)
   - node 3: in-degree 1 (from node 4)
   - node 4: in-degree 0

**bob:** now let's look at the edges and build the adjacency list to understand the graph structure better:

- the direct dependencies can be represented as:
  - 4 → 3
  - 4 → 0
  - 4 → 1
  - 0 → 1
  - 1 → 2
  - 3 → 1
  - 3 → 2

this gives us the following adjacency list:

- node 0: [1]
- node 1: [2]
- node 2: []
- node 3: [1, 2]
- node 4: [3, 0, 1]

**alice:** now we should perform a topological sort based on the existing structures. nodes with in-degree 0 can be visited first. we have node 4 with in-degree 0.

**bob:** let's perform the topological sort step-by-step:

1. start with nodes with in-degree 0: **[4]**.
2. we can visit node 4 first:
   - after visiting 4, we decrease the in-degrees of nodes 3, 0, and 1:
     - node 3's in-degree becomes 0 (from 1),
     - node 0's in-degree becomes 0 (from 1),
     - node 1's in-degree becomes 1 (from 2).
   - current ordered nodes: **[4]**.
3. now, we visit node 3 (it has in-degree 0):
   - after visiting 3, the in-degree of node 1 becomes 0.
   - current ordered nodes: **[4, 3]**.
4. next, we visit node 0 (it has in-degree 0):
   - after visiting 0, the in-degree of node 1 becomes 0.
   - current ordered nodes: **[4, 3, 0]**.
5. now, we visit node 1 (it has in-degree 0):
   - after visiting 1, the in-degree of node 2 becomes 1.
   - current ordered nodes: **[4, 3, 0, 1]**.
6. finally, we visit node 2:
   - current ordered nodes: **[4, 3, 0, 1, 2]**.

**alice:** the final complete topological order of the nodes is:

**[4, 3, 0, 1, 2]**

**bob:** we have verified that all nodes can indeed be visited without any contradictions in the order of dependencies.

**final answer:** yes, all nodes can be visited. the topological order is **[4, 3, 0, 1, 2]**.
