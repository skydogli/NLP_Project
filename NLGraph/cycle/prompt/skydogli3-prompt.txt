In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
We found that having GPT play different roles to simulate their collaborative task completion often leads to good results. When facing a problem, please play the roles of Alice and Bob, with each person responsible for some parts. Use modular statements to communicate and ultimately provide an answer.

Here is an example:
----Example Begins----
In a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 1 should be visited before node 2
node 3 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 2
node 4 should be visited before node 3
node 4 should be visited before node 0
node 4 should be visited before node 1
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
