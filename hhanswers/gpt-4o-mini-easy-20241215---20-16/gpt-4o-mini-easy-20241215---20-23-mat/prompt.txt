To find a topological sort in a directed graph, you can follow the following steps:
1. Identify all the nodes in the given graph.
2. Construct an adjacency matrix A. And let the diagonal elements of A be 1.
3. Calculate A^n, by do A:=A*A log(n) times, here n is the number of nodes. After each iteration, you can let each element take the minimum between 1 and it.
4. Let b(i) be the number of 0s in row i.
5. The topological order is just the ascending order of b.

In a directed graph with 10 nodes numbered from 0 to 9:
node 0 should be visited before node 5
node 0 should be visited before node 2
node 0 should be visited before node 8
node 0 should be visited before node 6
node 0 should be visited before node 9
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 0 should be visited before node 7
node 2 should be visited before node 8
node 2 should be visited before node 6
node 2 should be visited before node 9
node 2 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 4
node 3 should be visited before node 2
node 3 should be visited before node 8
node 3 should be visited before node 6
node 3 should be visited before node 9
node 3 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 7
node 4 should be visited before node 0
node 4 should be visited before node 2
node 4 should be visited before node 8
node 4 should be visited before node 6
node 4 should be visited before node 9
node 4 should be visited before node 1
node 4 should be visited before node 7
node 5 should be visited before node 9
node 5 should be visited before node 1
node 5 should be visited before node 7
node 6 should be visited before node 7
node 8 should be visited before node 6
node 8 should be visited before node 9
node 8 should be visited before node 1
node 8 should be visited before node 7
node 9 should be visited before node 1
node 9 should be visited before node 7
